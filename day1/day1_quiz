#Q1. Types

#Write code that:

#Creates a variable x with the value "42" (string)

#Creates a variable y with the value 42 (integer)

#Prints the type of each variable

#Explains in a comment why the types differ.

#Variables created correctly, types printed clearly, comment accurately explains string vs int.

# Q1. Types

x = "42"
print(type(x))      # str
y = 42
print(type(y))      # int

# The types differ because when we use values directly - y = 42, those are already numbers and python knows to multiply them. 
# However, when we use input() python stores the response as text, not as a number and reads them as a string. 



#Q2. Arithmetic Expressions

#Write code that:

#Creates two variables, a = 17, and b = 3

#Prints the result of each of the following expressions, with labels:

#a + b

#a - b

#a * b

#a / b

#a // b

#a % b

#Add a comment explaining the difference between / and //

# Q2. Arithmetic Expressions

# create two variables

a = 17
b = 3

# Print results of each expression with labels

print("a + b =", a + b)
print("a - b =", a - b)
print("a * b =", a * b)
print("a / b =", a / b)
print("a // b =", a // b)
print("a % b =", a % b)

# / this represents true division, results will always be floating - point number.
# // this represent floor division, returns largest integer less than or equal to the result.
# // in other words, it rounds down answer towards negative infinity.



#Q3. User Input and Conversion

#Write code that:

#Prompt the user for two numbers

#Prints their product

#Show what happens if you don't use float() or int() for conversions

#Correct the error by converting properly.
  
# Q3. User Input and Conversion - ERROR Incorrect without float() or int()

num1 = input("Enter one number:")     # did not use float() or int() therefore we will be getting an error.
num2 = input("Enter another number:")
product = num1 * num2
print("The product of two numbers is: ", product) 

TypeError                                 Traceback (most recent call last)
/tmp/ipython-input-3652877194.py in <cell line: 0>()
      3 num1 = input("Enter one number:")     # did not use float() or int() therefore we will be getting an error.
      4 num2 = input("Enter another number:")
----> 5 product = num1 * num2
      6 print("The product of two numbers is: ", product)

TypeError: can't multiply sequence by non-int of type 'str'

# Q3. User input and Conversion - Correct (float)

num1 = float(input("Enter one number: "))     # By adding float to the input it allows us to calculate the correct product. 
num2 = float(input("Enter another number: "))
product = num1 * num2
print(f"The product of the two numbers is: ", product)

# Q3. User input and Conversion - Correct (int)

num1 = int(input("Enter one number: "))
num2 = int(input("Enter another number: "))
product = num1 * num2
print(f"The product of the two numbers is: ", product)



#Q4. String Operations

#Write code that:

#Stores "Data" in a variable

#Stores "Science" in another variable

#Concatenates them with a space in between -> "Data Science"

#Repeats "Data" 3 times -> "DataDataData"

# Q4. Strings Operations - Concatenate "Data Science" with space in between. 

x = "Data"
y = "Science"
print (x + " " + y)  # Data Science
print(x * 3)         # DataDataData



#Q5. Mini - Project: Future Age Calculator

#Write code that:

#Asks the user for their name.

#Asks the user for their age

#Prints: "Hello [Name], in 5 years you will be [Age+5]

#Example:

#Enter your name: Alex

#Enter your age: 25

#Hello Alex, in 5 years you will be 30.

name = input("Enter your name: ")
age = int(input("Enter your age: "))
print(f"Hello {name}, in 5 years you will be {age + 5}.")
