# Day 2 — Conditionals & Error Handling

This folder contains practice programs from **Chapter 3 (Conditionals)** of *Python for Everybody*.  
The focus is on using `if/elif/else` logic, `and/or` operators, and `try/except` for error handling.

## Files
- `gross_pay_overtime.py` — Calculate gross pay with overtime (1.5× rate for hours > 40).
- `pay_with_error_handling.py` — Gross pay calculator with input validation (`try/except` to handle non-numeric input).
- `grade_classifier.py` — Convert a score (0.0–1.0) into a letter grade (A–F), with error handling and range checks.

## Skills Practiced
- Conditional statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`).
- Logical operators (`and`, `or`).
- Input validation with `try/except`.
- Mapping numeric ranges to categories (grading logic).
